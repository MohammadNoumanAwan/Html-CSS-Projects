                <h2>Founder of Pakistan</h2>
                <p><b>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b>, known as the "Quaid-e-Azam" (Great Leader), was the founder of Pakistan and a pivotal figure in the Indian subcontinent's struggle for independence from British rule. Born on December 25, 1876, in Karachi, Jinnah was a brilliant lawyer and a skilled politician who initially worked for Hindu-Muslim unity as part of the Indian National Congress. However, he later became the leader of the All-India Muslim League, advocating for the rights of Muslims in a predominantly Hindu India. His unwavering leadership and powerful vision led to the creation of Pakistan on August 14, 1947, as a separate homeland for Muslims. Jinnah’s dedication, diplomatic skills, and firm stance on constitutionalism earned him deep respect and a lasting legacy as the father of the nation.</p>
